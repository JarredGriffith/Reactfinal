        <h2>A little About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Jarred. I'm a 26-year Old Las Vegas native, passionate about software development. This may be the last step in my bootcamp but this is the first step in a career that I'm excited to enter, to explore and broaden my horizons with the knowledge that I've been given. I want to say thank you for all the help and guidance I've been given at promineo tech. </p>
